FeedMe: a lightweight RSS/feed fetcher.

FeedMe is sort of an RSS version of Sitescooper or AvantGo,
optimized for offline reading.

You can maintain a list of RSS feeds you want to read daily,
fetch them, cleaning up the HTML and (if you like) removing images,
then, optionally, convert them to a format that's easier to read
on a PDA or ebook reader.

It's written in Python and requires feedparser.
As of version 0.9 it's been split into two files and requires lxml.html.
