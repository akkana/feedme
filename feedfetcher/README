How to set up feedme so that it runs remotely on a web server,
triggered from a phone, laptop or other web-enabled device:

(Yes, these instructions are somewhat complex. But fortunately
you should only need to do it once!)

On the web server, create $SERVERDIR/feedme and $SERVERDIR/feeds
($SERVERDIR will probably be /var/www/ for simple setups).
They must both be writable by the web server's user (probably www-data).
Once feedmeparser.py has been created, $SERVERDIR/feedme probably
no longer needs to be writable, but $SERVERDIR/feeds and
/$SERVERDIR/feedme/.cache/feedme still will need to remain
writable by www-data forever.

Create $SERVERDIR/feedme/.config with an appropriate configuration
(feedme.conf plus optional links to other .conf files).
In feedme.conf, make sure that dir = points to a directory writable by
the web server. If you were using something like ~/feeds for your own
homedir, that may cause feedme not to start (and there will be no
obvious error message in that case, since it will have no place to log
the error). I suggest using $SERVERDIR/feeds where $SERVERDIR is the
same path you'd use from a login shell, e.g. /var/www/feeds.

Copy or link the binaries you need --
feedme, feedmeparser.py, and urlrss.cgi --
to $SERVERDIR/feedme/urlrss.cgi and make sure they're executable.
(Your web server will also need to be able to execute CGI scripts
in that directory. If not, mvoe urlrss.cgi to wherever CGI scripts
need to live. You may also need to move feedme and feedmeparser.py,
but I'm not sure since I allow CGIs anywhere.)

Now you should be able to initiate a feed by visiting the URL
pointing to urlrss.cgi, also specifying any "Extra URLs" you want
fetched if you use them. Extra URLs must be URL encoded and connected
by the string '%0a', for instance,
   urlrss.cgi?xtraurls=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.arduino.cc%2F2013%2F07%2F10%2Fsend-in-the-clones%2F%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fread.bi%2F10Lbfh9%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Ftechnology%2Farticle%2F2013-07%2Fdrones-civil-war%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisamericanlife.org%2Fblog%2F2015%2F05%2Fcanvassers-study-in-episode-555-has-been-retracted
If you don't need any extra URLs, it's safest to call
urlrss.cgi?xtraurls=none since in the past I've sometimes seen bugs
with Python's CGI module having trouble if the argument isn't present.

If everything is set up correctly, urlrss.cgi should save off the xtraurls
and then start feedme. You can then check on the progress of the feeding
by periodically checking your feeds directory (the one you specified
in feedme.conf with dir =). The last file to be written will be MANIFEST,
so when you see that, wait a few seconds (to make sure the manifest is
completely written) then fetch the MANIFEST, which will contain a list
of filenames fetched in the feed. Those are the files you need to download.
HTML files are first, image files last, so if you're on a bad connection
and have trouble fetching all the images, you can kill the fetch at
that point without losing any HTML content.


TESTING/DEBUGGING:

Testing feedme alone is easy: you can run it directly.
Make a backup of .cache/feedme/feedme.dat (or, if you've already run
feedme that day, make a backup of .cache/feedme/feedme.YYMMDDday.dat
and copy that repeatedly to feedme.dat) or use -n (--nocache).

But when you need to test the whole setup, including feedfetcher,
testing can be more difficult.
Start by saving the cache file, as noted in the previous paragraph.
With an appropriate cache in place, you can start feedme by using
curl or wget to call the special url from anywhere:
    wget "http://example.com/path/to/urlrss.cgi?xtraurls=none"

So a typical debug cycle might be:

On the server, as root or www-data or whoever:
  rm -rf /var/www/feeds/$(date +'%m-%d-%a')
  cp feedme.dat.sav /var/www/feedme/.cache/feedme.dat
From anywhere:
  wget --content-disposition 'http://example.com/feedme/urlrss.cgi?xtraurls=none'
or
  wget -O output.txt 'http://example.com/feedme/urlrss.cgi?xtraurls=none'

and then, on the server,
  tail -f /var/www/feeds/LOG
to see feedme's progress and check for error messages.
If LOG never appears, check /var/www/feeds/log-urlrss
which might explain why.

If you don't have shell access to the server, load
http://example.com/feeds/
in a browser and watch for log-urlrss, LOG and MANIFEST.

If you're tailing LOG rather than watching for MANIFEST,
feedme is finished when you see a line like:
Renaming /var/www/feeds/LOG to /var/www/feeds/10-28-Sat/LOG
