This is FeedViewer, a program for reading RSS feeds fetched by FeedMe.

This FeedViewer is a start at writing a Python version of the
[Android program FeedViewer](http://shallowsky.com/software/FeedViewer/).
It's written out of frustration over all the bugs and limitations of
the Android WebView library.
Unfortunately, it doesn't really help that since there's no Python
that Android can use for GUI apps.
