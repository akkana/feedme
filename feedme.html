<p>
Ever want to download RSS from news sites or blogs to your PDA?

<p>
<b>Download:</b> <a href="feedme-0.8">FeedMe 0.8</a>.</b>

<p>
You will need Python, and python's feedparser module (on Ubuntu or Arch,
that's the package <i>python-feedparser</i>).

<p>
There are lots of RSS readers -- but they all seem
oriented toward converting RSS to mail to be read in an HTML-capable
mail reader. I get enough mail, which I read in Mutt without much HTML
support. I wanted a way to get it onto my PDA in an easily readable,
simple format without images and tables and stylesheets and javascript
and all that other HTML cruft.

<p>
So I wrote FeedMe. It's very minimal but so far it seems to do the job.

<p>
FeedMe is sort of an RSS version of
<a href="http://sitescooper.taint.org/">Sitescooper</a>.
It produces either HTML or <a href="http://plkr.org">Plucker</a> format.

<p>
FeedMe can optionally convert each page to plain ascii --
useful if you're producing output for a Palm PDA.
For this option, set <code>ascii="yes"</code> in feedme.conf
and install my <a href="../ununicode/">ununicode</a> module
somewhere in your python path.

<p>
There's no documentation yet, but but the
<a href="feedme.conf">sample feedme.conf configuration file</a>
should be vaguely self-explanatory. Install it in
<i>~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feedme/feedme.conf</i> or
<i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i>
<p>
Supported formats since 0.7 include plucker and epub; to get them,
set <code>formats = epub</code> (or plucker, or plucker,epub to get both).
For HTML only and no additional formats, set <code>formats = none</code>
<p>
Downloaded HTML will be put in ~/feeds/ (which must exist; you can
specify a different location in feedme.conf).
<p>
Feedme can then convert the HTML into one of three formats:
epub, plucker, or fb2. You'll need to have appropriate conversion tools 
installed on your system: plucker for plucker format, calibre's
ebook-convert for the other two. You can specify more than one format,
separated by commas, in feedme.conf; or format=none if you only need
the downloaded HTML.

<h4>Maintenance:</h4>
Feedme uses three important directories:
<p>
Feedme's configuration file is <i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i>.
<p>
Feedme's cache is <i>~/.cache/feedme/feedme.dat</i>.
This file should remain relatively small if you have a sane number of feeds,
but it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it.
<p>
~/feeds is where it stores the downloaded HTML. 
Stories are downloaded as <i>sitename/number.html</i>, e.g.
<i>~/feeds/BBC_World_News/2.html</i>. These stories are cleaned
out every <i>save_days</i> (set in your feedme.conf).
<p>
If you save to formats beyond plain HTML, there may be other directories
used for the converted files; for example, plucker files are created in
<i>~/.plucker/feeds</i>.
This is never cleaned out by feedme, so you'll have to prune it yourself.
When I used plucker as my feed
reader, I had an alias that ran <code>rm ~/.plucker/feedme/*</code> 
to remove the  previous day's plucks just before I ran feedme.

<p>
FeedMe's license is GPLv2 or (at your option) later.
Thanks to Carla Schroder for the name suggestion!
