# This is set up to copy feeds from ~/feeds/DATEDIR/New_York_Times/
# (the $d is expanded before being passed to the helper)
# which is probably not what you want: if you're running a copyfiles
# helper, you may be running from a web server so ~ is the
# web server's user, not yours. Edit helper_arg as needed.
# This will copy from your user's feeds/$d/NY_Times to feeds/$d/New_York_Times
