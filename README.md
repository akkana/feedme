FeedMe: a lightweight RSS/feed fetcher.

FeedMe is sort of an RSS version of Sitescooper or AvantGo,
optimized for offline reading, especially on a small device like a phone,
PDA or ebook reader.

You can maintain a list of RSS feeds you want to read daily,
fetch them, cleaning up the HTML and (if you like) removing images,
then, optionally, convert them to a format that's easier to read
on your reading device.

It's written in Python and requires the feedparser module and lxml.html.

[The documentation for feedme is on my website](http://shallowsky.com/software/feedme/),
or in in docs/feedme.html in this repository.
