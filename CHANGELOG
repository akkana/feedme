    1.0b2:
    Accept multiple configuration files (e.g. one .conf file per site).
    Write each story's URL in the footer.

    Write the cache in a custom, human readable format instead of pickle.
    Skip entries so old they've expired from cache.
    Accept application/atom+xml as well as application/rss for RSS pages.

2016-11-23  Akkana Peck  <akkana@shallowsky.com>

    Fetch the RSS page with urllib2, not with feedparser,
    to guard against feedparser doing bogus charset remapping
    (May be just a bug on Debian Stretch's feedparser) and feedparser's
    inability to read from file:// URLs.
    Add allow_gzip = false option for sites where gzip is broken.

2010-08-02  Akkana Peck  <akkana@shallowsky.com>
