    1.0b2:
    Accept multiple configuration files (e.g. one .conf file per site).
    Write the cache in a custom, human readable format instead of pickle.
    Write each story's URL in the footer.
    Write .html files first to MANIFEST, so they'll be
    fetched first in case of dodgy networks.
    Skip entries so old they've expired from cache.
    Accept application/atom+xml as well as application/rss for RSS pages.
    Fix sites that use duplicate image names.

Nov 23, 2016:
    Fetch the RSS page with urllib2, not with feedparser,
    to guard against feedparser doing bogus charset remapping
    (May be just a bug on Debian Stretch's feedparser) and feedparser's
    inability to read from file:// URLs.
    Add allow_gzip = false option for sites where gzip is broken.

Oct 7, 2016:
    On URL errors, include a link so the user can try again.

    Add user_agent as a config option.
    Don't run if there's a feedme process already running.
    Guard against problems due to recent Python strptime parser changes.
    Handle pickle errors better.

Jun 25, 2013:
    Add "when" so sites can be checked less often than daily.

January 30, 2011:
    0.7: Clean up old feed directories (new config param "save_days").
    Handle multi-line configs, e.g. for skip_patterns.
    Match skip, start and end patterns that span multiple lines in the source page.
    Add stylesheet to output files, for use with html readers or FeedViewer.
    Fix case where truncated title includes a start tag but not the corresponding end tag.
    New "formats" parameter to specify which format(s) to generate.

    0.6: handle optional FB2 format; show author.

August 2, 2010:

March 3, 2010:
    0.4:

        Rewrite URLs so unfollowed links show up as coming from the original site, not file://
        error/msg logging: show at end, not inline
        handle failures like not finding plucker
        make backup of cache file
