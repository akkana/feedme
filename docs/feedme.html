<h1>FeedMe: a Lightweight Feed/RSS reader</h1>

<p>
Ever want to download RSS from news sites or blogs to your phone,
PDA, ebook reader, or other handheld device to read offline?

<p>
Feedme is a program for fetching stories from RSS or Atom feeds, from
news sites, blogs or any other site that offers a feed.
It saves simplified HTML files, or can translate to other formats
such as Epub, FB2, Plucker or plain text for devices that can't handle HTML.

<h2>About RSS</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS stands for
Really Simple Syndication</a>. It's a way of keeping track of things
you've already seen so you only read the ones that are new, and it's
widely used on sites like newspapers and blogs that are constantly
adding new content.

<p>
Google has recently re-added RSS support to Chrome:
<a href="https://www.popsci.com/diy/chrome-rss-feed-support/">Chrome’s
newest feature resurrects the ghost of Google Reader</a> (Popular
Science, Nov 2, 2021),
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445284/google-rss-chrome-android-feature-test">Google
rediscovers RSS: tests new feature to ‘follow’ sites in Chrome on
Android</a> (The Verge, May 2020).
<p>
A web search for <b>rss reader</b> will get you a list of other ways
to follow an RSS feed. I recommend limiting the search to "Past year"
since there are some older RSS readers that are no longer supported.
Wikipedia also has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">Comparison
of feed aggregators</a> ("feed aggregators" means more or less the
same thing as "RSS reader").

<h2>Download Feedme</h2>
<p>
FeedMe is now maintained on <a href="https://github.com/akkana/feedme">GitHub:
FeedMe</a>. It's currently at 1.0b5.

<p>
You will need Python 3, python's feedparser module (on Ubuntu or Debian,
that's the package <i>python3-feedparser</i>) and lxml (package python3-lxml).
Of course you can also install feedparser and lxml from PyPI if you prefer.

<p>
I know there are lots of other RSS readers -- but they all seem
oriented toward converting RSS to mail to be read in an HTML-capable
mail reader. I get enough mail, which I read in Mutt without much HTML
support. I wanted a way to get it onto a handheld device in an easily
readable, simple format that displays well on a small screen, without
images and tables and stylesheets and javascript and all that other
HTML cruft, and in a self-contained way so I can read it without
needing a net connection or using up data allocation.
You may remember older Palm apps that worked this way,
like AvantGo or Sitescooper.

<p>
So I wrote FeedMe. I've been using it daily for many years, so I guess
it works well enough for my purposes. Maybe it will work for you too.

<p>
FeedMe is sort of an RSS version of
<a href="http://sitescooper.taint.org/">Sitescooper</a>.
By default, it produces HTML that's been simplified to work well on
a small screen,
but optionally it can convert pages to plaintext, EPUB, FB2 or
<a href="http://plkr.org">Plucker</a> format.

<h2>The feedme.conf file</h2>

<p>
The <a href="siteconf/feedme.conf">sample feedme.conf configuration file</a>
should be vaguely self-explanatory, though it doesn't contain every option.
<p>
Install your <i>feedme.conf</i>
<i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i> (the usual Linux location), or
<i>~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feedme/feedme.conf</i>.

<h3>General options</h3>
<p>
The feedme.conf file should start with a set of default options
in a section labeled <code>[DEFAULT]</code>.

<p>
These options apply to the whole feedme process:

<dl>
<dt>
  ascii
<dd>
    Convert all pages to plain ASCII. Useful for reading devices like Palm
    that can't display other character sets reliably.
<dt>
  dir
<dd>
    Where to save the collected pages.
    See save_days for how long they will be kept.
<dt>
  formats
<dd>
    Comma-separated list of output formats.
    Default "none", which will result in HTML output.
    Other options: epub, fb2, plucker.
<dt>
  verbose
<dd>
    Print lots of debugging chatter while feeding.
<dt>
  min_width
<dd>
    The minimum number of characters in an item link. Links shorter than this
    will be padded to this length (to make tapping easier). Default 25.
<dt>
  save_days
<dd>
    How long to retain feeds locally.

<td>
  order
<dd>
    The order of the feeds you'd like to see: an ordered list (one name
    per line) of the full names (not filenames) of each feed.
    Feed directories will have _01, _02 etc. prepended.
    Feeds not listed in order will be sorted alphabetically after
    the ordered ones.

</dl>

<h3>Defining a new feed</h3>
<p>
The recommended way of adding a new feed is by creating (or linking)
a new file in your feedme config directory, the same location where
<i>feedme.conf</i> lives.
<p>
The <i>siteconf</i> directory here contains a collection of sample feeds.
They aren't guaranteed to be up-to-date; sometimes I give up on a site
and stop updating it. If you don't need to make any changes, the easiest
way to use these files is to symlink them into your feedme config directory:
for example,
<code>ln -s ~/src/feedme/siteconf/washington-post.conf ~/.config/feedme/</code>
<p>
If you wish, you can also define feeds by adding sections directly to
the <i>feedme.conf</i> file.
<p>
To define a new feed, start by setting a name, in square brackets,
like <code>[Anytown Post-Dispatch]</code>
Set <i>url</i> to the site's RSS URL.
Then go to the RSS page in a browser, click on a story,
view the HTML source of the story, find the place where the actual story
begins (it may be three quarters of the way down the page or even
farther) and find something that indicates the start of the story,
after all the sidebars and advertising and tracking javascript and
other cruft. Save this as <code>page_start</code>.
Optionally, scroll down to the end of the story and find
a <code>page_end</code> as well. Your site file should look something
like this:
<pre>
[Anytown Post-Dispatch]
url = http://example.com/feeds.rss
page_start = &lt;story&gt;
page_end = &lt;/story&gt;
</pre>
(though page_start and page_end will probably be more complicated
than that on most sites).
<p>
At this point you can test it by running feedme on the name you just set:
<pre>
feedme -n 'Anytown Post-Dispatch'
</pre>
<p>
The -n (nocache) option tells feedme to fetch stories even if there's
nothing new; while testing, you want that since otherwise, after the
first time, feedme will tell you that there are no new stories to fetch.

<p>
Once you have a basic site, you can start tuning the site-specific options.

<h3>Basic options for specific feeds</h3>
<p>
Here are some basic options that can be set in
the <code>[DEFAULT]</code> section of your <i>feedme.conf</i>,
and can be overridden for specific feeds:

<dl>
<dt>
  url
<dd>
    The RSS URL for the site.
<dt>
  levels
<dd>
    Level 1: only save the RSS page.
    Level 2: save sub-pages.
    <br>
    Level 1.5: on sites that put the full story in the feed page,
    create story sub-pages using the text from the feed
    rather than fetching each sub-page. Works well with rss_entry_size.
<dt>
  skip_images
<dd>
    Don't save images. Default true.
<dt>
  skip_links:
<dd>
    For sites with levels=1 where you just want a single news feed and
    never want to click on anything (e.g. slashdot), this can eliminate
    distracting links that you might tap on accidentally while scrolling.
    (My husband wanted this. I doubt many other people will want it.)
<dt>
allow_repeats:
<dd>
    Some sites re-use the same URL and ID for new content: for instance,
    a site might have a page for the monthly photo contest that gets
    updated once a month. For these sites, set allow_repeats.
    The default is false, because many news sites like to make trivial
    tweaks to yesterday's story, so you see the same story day after day
    unless you filter out stories you've seen before.

<dt>
  simplify
<dd>
    Clean up the HTML: try to remove things like text colors and sizes
    that sometimes make stories unreadable.
<dt>
  continue_on_timeout
<dd>
    Normally, if one page times out, feedme will assume the site is down.
    On sites that link to content from many different URLs, set this
    to true.
<dt>
  encoding
<dd>
    Normally feedme will try to guess the encoding from the page.
    But some pages lie, so use this to override that.
<dt>
  nocache
<dd>
    Don't check whether we've seen an entry before: collect everything.
<dt>
  nonlocal_images
<dd>
    Normally feedme will ignore images from other domains (usually ads).
    But some sites link to images from all over; set this to true in that case.
<dt>
  block_nonlocal_images
<dd>
    If we're not allowing nonlocal images, setting block_nonlocal to true
    will rewrite the img src attribute of all nonlocal images to
    a bogus value.
    This will cause some "broken images" tags to show.
    Use it if you're on a fixed data plan and don't want to incur
    extra data charges downloading images while reading stories.
    Default false.

</dl>


<h3>Trickier Site Options</h3>
<p>
These options aren't as easy to explain or understand,
but you may need them for particular sites.

<dl>

<dt>
  cookiefile
<dd>
  For this site, use cookies from a specific browser profile.
  Currently only Firefox's <i>cookies.sqlite</i> is supported.
  The file must be writable (sqlite3 insists on that even if
  you never change anything in it).

<dt>
  max_srcset_size
<dd>
  On sites that use <i>srcset</i> for their images, how big do we want
  them to think our screen is? Integer, default 800.
<dt>
  rss_entry_size
<dd>
    Limit RSS entries to this many characters. This is for sites that
    put the entire story into the RSS page.

<dt>alt_domains
<dd>
  Normally, feedme will only fetch images from the same domain
  as the site being read, and if nonlocal_images is set, it will
  replace all other images with a dummy image.
  alt_domains specifies a list of domains that are acceptable sources
  of images for a given site, for sites that host images somewhere other
  than their normal domain.

<dt>single_page_pats
<dd>
  Sites that spread stories over many pages often have a naming
  convention in their "view as single page" URLs. This is a pattern,
  e.g. http://example.com/.*single.html. Feedme will look for
  this pattern in a story, and if it sees it, it will follow the
  link and use it instead of the original story link.

<dt>multipage_pat
<dd>
  Pattern of URLs that might be linked when a story is broken up into
  several pages.

<dt>skip_nodes
<dd>
  For sites that embed annoying things in the middle of stories:
  maybe video clips, or ads, or distracting pull-quotes,
  you can specify an HTML tag plus an attribute to look for.
  Syntax looks like:
<pre>
skip_pats = div class="advertisement"
    span class="junk"
</pre>
  The attribute (e.g. "junk") is a regular expression as used by BeautifulSoup.

<dt>skip_pats
<dd>
  For sites that embed annoying things in the middle of stories:
  maybe video clips, or ads, or distracting pull-quotes.
  Anything matching one of the skip_pats regular expressions
  will be deleted from the story.
  Note: skip_nodes is usually a better way to skip.

<dt>skip_link_pats
<dd>
  Skip links with these patterns.
<dt>skip_title_pats
<dd>
  Skip anything with titles containing these patterns.
<dt>skip_content_pats
<dd>
  Skip anything whose content includes these patterns.
<dt>index_skip_content_pats
<dd>
  Skip anything where the index content includes:

<td>when
<dd>
  When to check this site, if not always.
  May be a weekday, e.g. Sat, or a month date, e.g. 1 to check only
  on the first day of any month.
</dl>

<p>
A few options, like alt_domains,
page_start, page_end, or any of the "pats" options, can understand
multiple regular expression patterns. Specify them by putting them on separate
lines (whitespace at the beginning is optional and ignored):
<pre>
skip_pats = style=".*?"
  Follow us on.*?</div>
skip_link_pats = skip_link_pat = http://www.site.com/articles/video/
  http://www.site.com/articles/podcasts/
</pre>

<h3>Helper Modules</h3>
<p>
For sites that can't be simply downloaded, you can define a helper
Python module. There are <i>page_helpers</i> that can fetch URLs
-- for instance, if a site requires JavaScript, you can use a
package like Selenium to fetch it --
and <i>feed_helpers</i> that can get a feed that doesn't have RSS.
See <i>helpers/README.md</i> for details.

<h3>Output Formats</h3>
<p>
Feedme always produces HTML as an output format.
If that's all you need, the default <code>formats = none</code> is fine.
<p>
Downloaded HTML will be put in ~/feeds/ (which must exist; you can
specify a different location as <i>dir</i> in feedme.conf).
<p>
Feedme can then convert the HTML into one of three formats:
epub, plucker, or fb2.
To get them,
set <code>formats = epub</code> (or plucker, or fb2).
You can specify multiple formats, comma separated, e.g. <i>epub,fb2</i>.
<p>
You'll need to have appropriate conversion tools
installed on your system: plucker for plucker format, calibre's
ebook-convert for the other two.
<p>
FeedMe can optionally convert each page to plain ascii, eliminating
accented characters and such (displaying them used to be a problem
on Palm PDAs, but shouldn't be needed for most modern devices).
For this option, set <code>ascii="yes"</code> in feedme.conf and install my
<a href="http://shallowsky.com/software/ununicode/">ununicode</a> module
somewhere in your python path.
<p>
Warning: these conversions haven't been tested in a while, though
they used to work fine. If you have problems, please file a bug or
contact me.

<h2>Maintenance:</h2>
<p>
Feedme uses three important directories:
<p>
Feedme's configuration file is <i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i>.

<p>
~/feeds is where it stores the downloaded HTML by default
(you can change this as <code>dir</code> in the <i>feedme.conf</i>).
Stories are downloaded as <i>sitename/number.html</i>, e.g.
<i>~/feeds/BBC_World_News/2.html</i>. These stories are cleaned
out every <i>save_days</i> (set in your feedme.conf).
<p>
The third important directory is the cache directory (see below).
<p>
If you save to formats beyond plain HTML, there may be other directories
used for the converted files; for example, plucker files are created in
<i>~/.plucker/feeds</i>.
This is never cleaned out by feedme, so you'll have to prune it yourself.
When I used plucker as my feed
reader, I had an alias that ran <code>rm ~/.plucker/feedme/*</code>
to remove the  previous day's plucks just before I ran feedme.

<h3>The Cache, and Fixing Bad Runs</h3>
<p>
Feedme's cache is <i>~/.cache/feedme/feedme.dat</i>.
This file should remain relatively small if you have a sane number of feeds,
but it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it.
Feedme will also keep backup cache files for about a week, named by date;
you can use these to go back to an earlier state in case you lost your
feeds or accidentally deleted something.
<p>
Old cache files are backed up for roughly a week. If you run feedme and
something goes wrong, you can reset back to the previous cache file.
For instance, if everything was fine when you ran feedme on Monday May 15,
but something goes wrong on Tuesday, go to your cache directory and
you'll see <em>feedme.dat</em> from Tuesday (a few minutes old),
and <em>feedme-23-05-15-Mon.dat</em>
so the fix is:
<pre>
cp feedme-23-05-15-Mon.dat feedme.dat
</pre>
and then when you run feedme again, it will re-fetch all of Tuesday's stories
as though the first bad run never happened.

<h2>License</h2>
<p>
FeedMe's license is GPLv2 or (at your option) any later GPL version.
<p>
Thanks to Carla Schroder for the name suggestion!

<h2>Reading Your Feeds</h2>
<p>
By default, FeedMe fetches feeds to simplified HTML files on your
local filesystem. You can read them there with a browser or any other app
you prefer; or you can save to a format like EPUB to read on an ebook
reader.
<p>
Currently, I run FeedMe daily on a web server;
then I use an Android program I wrote,
<a href="/software/FeedViewer/">FeedViewer</a>,
to download the day's feeds to my phone and read them there.
<p>
I'm the first to confess that FeedViewer isn't very well documented, though,
especially the process of downloading from a server.
If you're trying to use FeedViewer and can't figure it out,
let me know, otherwise I may never get around to documenting it.
